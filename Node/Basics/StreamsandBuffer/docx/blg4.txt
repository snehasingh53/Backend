 New ChunkA professional-looking DOCX document with:

Formatted title and headings

Random paragraphs of text

Bullet points and numbered lists

A data table with random values

Space for an image (uncomment to use)

A footer with generation date

Customization options:
Change the filename by passing a different parameter

Adjust the number of paragraphs, list items, or table rows

Add more sections or different elements as needed

The resulting document will look like a real business document with varied content and formatting.

readStream.on('data',(chunk)=>{// on is an event listener
    console.log('------- NEW CHUNK------');
    console.log(chunk);
    writeStream.write('/n New Chunk');
    writeStream.write(chunk);
}) what is wrong in this code
There are a few issues with your code snippet. Here's what's wrong and how to fix it:

Issues:
String Literal Syntax: You're using /n instead of \n for a new line

Path Separator: Forward slashes in strings don't need to be escaped (but \n does)

Error Handling: Missing error event handlers for both streams

Stream Management: No handling for backpressure (when write can't keep up with read)

Encoding: Chunks might be buffers that should be converted to stringsA professional-looking DOCX document with:
